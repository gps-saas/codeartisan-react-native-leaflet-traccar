## Installation üì¶

Start a new expo project

```bash
npx create-expo-app@latest mobile-tracker --template blank
```

Install **CodeArtisan React Native Leaflet Traccar**, simply run the following command:

```bash
npm install @gps-saas/codeartisan-react-native-leaflet-traccar
```

install dependencies

```bash
npx expo install react-native-webview@13.8.6
npx expo install expo-status-bar
```

Sample code to load the map...

```javascript
import { SafeAreaView } from "react-native";
import { MapView } from "@gps-saas/codeartisan-react-native-leaflet-traccar";
import { StatusBar } from "expo-status-bar";

export default function App() {
  return (
    <SafeAreaView
      style={{
        flex: 1,
      }}
    >
      <MapView
        style={{
          width: "100%",
          height: "100%",
        }}
        mapOptions={{
          zoomControl: false,
        }}
        mapOnClick={(data) => {
          console.log("map on click", data);
        }}
        showMarkerClicked
      />
      <StatusBar style="dark" />
    </SafeAreaView>
  );
}
```

As we are using native modules, we need to build and install a development build, so:

```bash
rm -rf node_modules ios android
npx expo prebuild
npx eas build --profile development --platform android
yarn start
```

Create a resources folder and move your icons to that folder and load this icons on your app

```javascript
import bicycle from "./resources/newIcons/bicycle.png";
import boat from "./resources/newIcons/boat.png";
import bus from "./resources/newIcons/bus.png";
import car from "./resources/newIcons/car.png";
import camper from "./resources/newIcons/camper.png";
import crane from "./resources/newIcons/crane.png";
import helicopter from "./resources/newIcons/helicopter.png";
import motorcycle from "./resources/newIcons/motorcycle.png";
import offroad from "./resources/newIcons/offroad.png";
import person from "./resources/newIcons/person.png";
import pickup from "./resources/newIcons/pickup.png";
import plane from "./resources/newIcons/plane.png";
import scooter from "./resources/newIcons/scooter.png";
import ship from "./resources/newIcons/ship.png";
import tractor from "./resources/newIcons/tractor.png";
import train from "./resources/newIcons/train.png";
import tram from "./resources/newIcons/tram.png";
import trolleybus from "./resources/newIcons/trolleybus.png";
import truck from "./resources/newIcons/truck.png";
import van from "./resources/newIcons/van.png";
import default from "./resources/newIcons/default.png";
import animal from "./resources/newIcons/animal.png";
```

Install that apk on your android device and point to your expo server.
